                <p>Last friday, on October 22nd 2020, was held the third part of a virtual meeting by IVADO entitled "Digital October". This session was dedicated to "Tommorow's algorithm" with 6 student's presentations [1]. This conference was targetting a fairly large audience with students, researchers and industrialists, gathered around issues related to the use of data. </p>
<p>In that context, I had the opportunity to introduce a part of my research topic : an extension of Physics Informed Neural Networks with a modal approach. The idea was to describe the context, related challenges and fields of applications of this kind of techniques, rather than the actual results. I tried to show examples on how to use decomposition methods to make a problem easier to approximate so that it is possible to address more complex configurations.</p>
<p>This was also a new experience as we were experimentating a live conference on a lightboard at Polytechnique Montréal. I was filmed behind a large glass and my slides (with a black background removed) were added to this capture using OBS studio. Then the video stream was sent to Zoom through a virtual camera channel. In the end it proved to work rather well (except some windows that poped up at random time, but it was more likely a problem from my computer !). With more training, there could be a better use of this set up to make the presentation more dynamic. A huge Thank to Frédérick and Sébastien for the time and help they gave me to prepare this talk.</p>
<p>The replay is available on the LM2 Youtube Channel [2] and more detailed results might be presented in an article currently under writing (with code and data) !</p>

                    <img src="https://GRaynaud.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/9/IMG_20200719_151404550.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>Scientific knowledge is built "on the shoulders of giants", to paraphrase de Chartres. Hence the need for appropriate referencing of the work of researchers around the world. To meet this need, the scientific community has adopted citation standards and tools to identify publications. Among these, the doi (Digital Object Identifier, a unique and formatted character string) has been in use since 2000 [5]. But currently, when writing a report, a thesis or an article with \( \LaTeX \), a popular formatting language, an external tool is needed to gather bibliographic information by ourselves. This could be done automatically by directly using such unique identifiers.</p>
<p>This statement is presented and explained in this short paper [1]. Basically, the idea is to refer to a publication with a direct, unique and global id, instead of giving a reference key linked to a dictionnary in a .bib file that might change from one project to another. This Bibtex file must either be constructed by hand or be exported from your favorite references manager. And this has to be carried out every time a new reference is added to your draft or your dissertation.</p>
<p>Besides, I start to have an extended collection of articles in my Zotero... So when I export a folder to a bibtex file, there are several unused references so it can make it unnecessarily weighty. And more problematically, there also might be some omissions... that lead to errors while compiling the \( \LaTeX \) project.</p>
<p>This is a bit a shame as most of cited content in scientific litterature has an unique id that could serve directly as the reference key for Bibtex. This is what is proposed in the example from my github [3] where I adapted python codes from [1] and [2]. This goes along from a \( \LaTeX \) demo (inspired from Overleaf documentation [4]). In order to run it, just execute the script in <code>Python_libs/Split.py</code> and it will generate a .bib reference file.</p>
<p>The script browses all the .tex files contained in the directories and sub-directories of your \( \LaTeX \) project. It detects the citation keys <code>\cite{key}</code> in either DOI or arXiv id format. For each identifier, the information is retrieved and a .bib file is generated. A list of existing reference files .bib can be merged with the new file (in case there is no arXiv/doi id).</p>
<p>As an exemple, if you use arXiv format <code>\cite{2003.02751v2}</code> or a doi <code>\cite{10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045}</code>, the following information will be added in the generated .bib file</p>
<pre> @article{2003.02751v2, 
  Author = {Ehsan Haghighat and Maziar Raissi and Adrian Moure and Hector Gomez and Ruben Juanes}, 
  Title = {A deep learning framework for solution and discovery in solid mechanics},
  ... }

@article{10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045,
  doi = {10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045}, 
  url = {https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jcp.2018.10.045},
  year = 2019, 
  month = {feb}, 
  ... }
</pre>
<p>The arXiv format detection and retrieving uses the library arxiv2bib [2].</p>
<p>I adapted a code from [1] with some changes as :</p>
<ul>
<li>Format verification for doi format</li>
<li>Replacing the usual reference key by the doi so that it matches the \cite{doi} and nothing is to change in the \( \LaTeX \) document</li>
<li>Proper export to bib file and merging with an existing bibtex dictionnary</li>
<li>Sub folder checking for .tex files research</li>
<li>arXiv id support thanks to arxiv2bib module</li>
<li>Adding some comments</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the idea might be to launch it during \( \LaTeX \) compilation. This could be done with adding this piece of code in your main .tex file :</p>
<pre>\usepackage{python}
\begin{python}[Python_libs/Split.py]
\end{python}
</pre>
<p>Don't hesitate if you have ideas of improvements or questions. The code is publicly available at my github [3].</p>
